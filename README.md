# Collection of LXD Usage Tips

A collection of LXD tips/hints I've found online over time related to how to use/configure/manage LXD containers.

Please feel free to contribute to improving the information in this LibreOffice document.

*I am not promising that all of this information is valid today as LXD itself has evolved since it was first introduced several years ago.   So **feel free to correct anything you find that is not accurate** and/or add any new information you might have to contribute.*

Note: at the time I collected much of this I didn't think to also copy the source/attribute of the original... for that I appologize and if you see anything that was authored by you please add a note if you so choose.
