# Collection-of-LXD-Usage-Tips

A collection of LXD tips/hints I've found online over time - feel free to contribute to improving this information

*Over the past few years I've come across a lot of good information related to how to use/configure/manage LXD containers.*

Because I am forgetful I often copied this bits & pieces into a single LibreOffice document so I could find the info later.

*NOTE:  I am not vouching that all of this information is valid today as LXD itself has evolved since it was first introduced several years ago.   So feel free to correct anything you find that is not accurate and/or add any new information you might have to contribute.*
