# Collection-of-LXD-Usage-Tips

A collection of LXD tips/hints I've found online over time related to how to use/configure/manage LXD containers.

Please feel free to contribute to improving the information in this LibreOffice document.

*NOTE:  I am not promising that all of this information is valid today as LXD itself has evolved since it was first introduced several years ago.   So feel free to correct anything you find that is not accurate and/or add any new information you might have to contribute.*
